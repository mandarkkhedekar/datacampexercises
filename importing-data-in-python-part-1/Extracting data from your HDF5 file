#Extracting data from your HDF5 file
#In this exercise, you'll extract some of the LIGO experiment's actual data from the HDF5 file and you'll visualize it.

#To do so, you'll need to first explore the HDF5 group 'strain'.

#Assign the HDF5 group data['strain'] to group.
#In the for loop, print out the keys of the HDF5 group in group.
#Assign to the variable strain the values of the time series data data['strain']['Strain'] using the attribute .value.
#Set num_samples equal to 10000, the number of time points we wish to sample.
#Execute the rest of the code to produce a plot of the time series data in LIGO_data.hdf5.

# Import packages
import numpy as np
import h5py

# Assign filename: file
file = 'LIGO_data.hdf5'

# Load file: data
data = h5py.File(file, 'r')

# Print the datatype of the loaded file
print (type(data))

# Print the keys of the file
for key in data.keys():
    print(key)
